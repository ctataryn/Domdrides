                Eric Evans' book <u>Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</u> prescribes a
                domain-driven approach to designing object-oriented software.  The Domdrides library tries to help
                facilitate this design approach for projects written in Java.  Currently, Domdrides helps with the
                following domain-driven design concepts:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Entities</b> - an entity is a persistent object in your domain model such as a Person or an
                Account.  Domdrides provides useful base classes for implementing entities.</li>
                <li><b>Repositories</b> - a repository contains entities of a specific type.  For example, you might
                have a PersonRepository or AccountRepository in your domain model.  Implementations for
                    <a href="apidocs/org/domdrides/hibernate/repository/HibernateRepository.html">Hibernate</a>,
                    <a href="apidocs/org/domdrides/jpa/repository/JpaRepository.html">The Java Persistence API (JPA)</a>
                    , and <a href="apidocs/org/domdrides/ibatis/repository/IbatisRepository.html">iBATIS</a> are
                    available for you to extend.
